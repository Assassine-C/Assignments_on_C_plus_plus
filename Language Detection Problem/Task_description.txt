Task Overview: You are provided with multiple languages, each containing a set of unique words.
Your goal is to determine which language(s) a given sentence most closely aligns with based on
the words it contains. Specifically, you need to find the language(s) that have the most words
in common with the sentence, and return their index (starting from 1). If multiple languages have
the same number of matching words, output all of them in ascending order.

Problem Details:
You are given N languages, and each language has a list of words.

You also receive a sentence consisting of multiple words.

The task is to find the language(s) that share the most words with the sentence, and print their indices (starting from 1).

If multiple languages have the same number of shared words, you should output all their indices.

Constraints:
The number of languages N will be between 1 and 15.

Each language contains Li words (where 1 ≤ Li ≤ 100).

The sentence has M words (where 1 ≤ M ≤ 1000).

Every word in the sentence and in the languages consists of English alphabet characters and may also include digits.

It's guaranteed that the sentence contains at least one word from at least one language.

Input Format:
The first line contains an integer N: the number of languages.

The next N lines describe the words in each language. Each line starts with an integer Li (the number of words in the i-th language),
followed by Li space-separated words.

The next line contains an integer M: the number of words in the sentence.

The last line contains the sentence itself: M space-separated words.

Output Format:
For the given sentence, output the index (starting from 1) of the language(s) that have the most words in common with the sentence.
If multiple languages have the same number of matching words, output all the indices in ascending order.
