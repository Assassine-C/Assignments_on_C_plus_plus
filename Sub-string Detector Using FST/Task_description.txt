Task Overview: You are given a substring C and a string S, both containing only lowercase letters.
Your task is to use a Finite State Transducer (FST) to detect the number of times C appears as a
substring in S. If the substring C is not found, output NOT DETECTED.

Problem Details:
You need to implement a Finite State Transducer (FST) to solve the problem.

The FST should process the characters of the string S and detect when C appears in it.

Your implementation should count how many times the substring C appears in S.

If C is not found in S, print "NOT DETECTED".

Requirements:
You should implement a class named lastname_firstname_FST (replace lastname and firstname with your actual last and first names).

The class should have a constructor that takes the substring C as a parameter.

The class should also have a function process(char) that processes each character from the string S,
updating the state and returning 1 or 0 based on whether the substring C is detected.

FST Logic:
The constructor should initialize the substring and the initial state of the FST.

The process(char) function should update the state based on the input character and the substring,
and return either 1 (detected) or 0 (not detected).
