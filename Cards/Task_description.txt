Task Overview:
Ahmed and Karim are playing a card duel, where each card has a positive digit (1–9) written on it.
Each player organizes their cards in a chosen order, and based on the sequences, you (the judge) must determine
the winner by following specific rules.


Game Rules:

Cards are compared from left to right.

If the same number appears in both players’ collections, the first occurrence from each player is matched in a "duel."

If Ahmed's card appears earlier, he earns a point; if Karim’s appears earlier, he earns a point; if they appear at the
same position, no points are awarded.

Once a card participates in a duel, it is considered "used" and cannot be reused.


Input Format:

Two lines of card numbers, ending with a 0 on each line.

The first line is Ahmed's card sequence, the second is Karim's.

The input is always valid.


Output Format:

First line: Ahmed’s winning cards (in the input order) or - if none.

Second line: Karim’s winning cards (in the input order) or - if none.

Third line: The winner's name (Ahmed / Karim) or Tie if scores are equal.


Constraints:

1 ≤ N, M ≤ 999
