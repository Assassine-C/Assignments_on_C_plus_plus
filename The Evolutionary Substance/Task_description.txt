Task Overview: Imagine a substance that can transform an animal into a "better" version of itself,
making it live a shorter number of days. The task involves simulating the application and removal
of this substance on various animals, as well as managing their life cycles and interactions within
specific containers. The animals can attack each other, but the containers also have restrictions
and behaviors based on the animal type.


Classes and Structure:


Animal Types:

Animals start as one of these types: Mouse, Fish, or Bird. When the substance is applied, these
animals transform into their "better" versions: BetterMouse, BetterFish, or BetterBird. If the
substance is overused, they become Monsters, which can no longer transform back and will die after one day.


Containers:

Cage: For storing animals like Mice or Birds.

Aquarium: For Fish and their better versions.

Freedom: A special container where animals can’t be affected by the substance and can’t interact with others.


Animal Life Cycle:

Each animal has a daysLived count (maximum of 10). After the substance is applied, the number of days lived
is halved (rounded up). If the animal reaches 11 days, it dies.


Interactions:

Animals in the same container can attack each other. The attacker kills the attacked animal.

Animals can talk and introduce themselves, sharing their name and days lived.

The substance can only be applied or removed in specific containers, and only animals in the "better" states can have the substance removed.


Commands to be Implemented:

CREATE <TYPE> <NAME> IN <CONTAINER> <N> – Create an animal with a specified type and number of days lived, and place it in the container.

APPLY_SUBSTANCE <CONTAINER> <TYPE> <POS> – Apply the substance to an animal at a given position in the container.

REMOVE_SUBSTANCE <CONTAINER> <TYPE> <POS> – Remove the substance from a "better" animal.

ATTACK <CONTAINER> <TYPE> <POS1> <POS2> – Animal at position POS1 attacks animal at POS2.

TALK <CONTAINER> <TYPE> <POS> – Animal talks, sharing its name and days lived.

PERIOD – Increase the age of all animals by one day. If an animal reaches the limit (11 days), it dies.


Behavior Rules:

Animals in the Freedom container cannot attack, and no substances can be applied or removed from them.

Applying the substance to a "better" animal turns it into a Monster with 1 day of life, which cannot revert back.

Monsters kill all animals in the container when they appear and are moved to the Freedom container.

The containers should automatically reorder animals based on their daysLived after any action.
